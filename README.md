A custom script in ArcMap that aids in survey data integration. This script transfers attributes from a surveyed sewer gravity main feature class into another sewer gravity main feature feature class, assumed to be an utility provider's feature class. Some editing will be required, particularly in the field names and setting a workspace.

This script was written in a Replica work environment, not a versioned environment. For versioned environments, the workspace is set to the server. Check within the Roaming folder: C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.6\ArcCatalog\
